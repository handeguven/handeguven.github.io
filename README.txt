I implemented a webpage with my name, photo and links to a short biography and my resume. My resume contains information about my education and professional experience as well as related activities and skills. The top menu has links to the home page, my bio and resume. 

I was able to implement the HTML and CSS parts of the project correctly. Initially I had trouble with navigating git and github, so I committed things more times than necessary. I received help about using git and github from former COMP20 student and COMP15 TA Bill Yung. 

I worked approximately 6-7 hours on this project.
